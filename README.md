# Distributed-Storage-File-System-DSFS-
The Distributed Storage File System (DSFS) is a C++-based distributed file storage system that efficiently stores, retrieves, and manages files across multiple nodes using an HTTP-based communication model. The system splits files into smaller chunks, distributes them across multiple storage nodes, and retrieves them seamlessly when needed.
